Together as a team, we broke down the tasks into easily achievable sprints.  Working on seperate branches, commits were made and merged with the master as milestones were met.

To begin, we discussed the expectations of the client and settled on a design and theme for the entire build.

The framework of the website was built using pair programming but as a group, making sure that all of us could easily locate blocks by name to be populated with data and information.
